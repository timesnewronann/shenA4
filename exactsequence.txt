Producer and consumer problem 

Worry about the different parties to go with the walk through first

2 Producers and 2 Consumers 

Connected by a bounded buffer (brokerage queue): hold the incoming trade requests

Has a max-capacity of 16 before getting blocked

One more constraint: at most 5 bitcoins at the most 16 in the queue for total number of reqeusts

Can have at most 16 ethereum there's no constraints 

Up to you to setup another semaphore to set up that constraints 

First sort out the necessary constraints

Implicitly have 16 ethereums 

For mutex access to the queue :
semaphore for 16 max capacity -> semaphore
5 bitcoins -> semaphore 
16 ethereums -> semaphore 
mutex -> semaphore 

main needs to wait for the consumer that consumed the last request(item) -> need a semaphore

for any synchronization do not use busy waiting or you get fucked and get 0
DO NOT USE ANY INTEGER FOR ACCOMPLISHING THESE

understand that you can use integers to track how many requests you have produced and consumed 

do not use the numbers to perform the synchronization

If the queue is full can not put more items than the producer Has

Cannot use integer to be used as a flag to ensure the order of execution
