when testing only the bitcoinproducer and blockchain x, most of the time it shows the expected report, and 
othertimes shows a segmentation fault at the line that updates the *consumed array that we pass into the 3rd argument 
of log_request_removed:

sharedData->coinsConsumed[consumer][*requestedType]++;

When using gdb to print out the requested type at the instance of the segfault, we get Ethereum when we only expect 
bitcoin, which I am confused about since the previous logging has been able to identify the request type as bitcoin. 
Could it be the initialization of our enum request types that could be causing a problem? 





When handling two different blockchains and coins, the broker overproduces and the bitcoin goes negative
